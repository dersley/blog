# The Boardroom

You wake up, face down on a boardroom table. There's an intercom by your face.

> *"Who are y---"*

You hear a cough, some paper shuffling over the intercom.

> *"Sorry, let's start again... Explain this data."*

You sit up, waiting for your eyes to adjust to the light. You rub them and look to the
far wall, there's a projector screen hanging from it, showing some data points:

```{python}
#| echo: false

n = 5000
x = np.random.normal(size=n)
y = np.random.normal(size=n)
p = invlogit(5 * (x + y) - 5)
filter = np.random.binomial(n=1, p=p, size=n).astype(bool)

df = pd.DataFrame({
    "X": x[filter],
    "Y": y[filter]
})

chart = (
    alt.Chart(df.head(5))
    .mark_point()
    .encode(
        alt.X("X:Q", axis=alt.Axis(grid=False)),
        alt.Y("Y:Q", axis=alt.Axis(grid=False)),
    )
    .properties(
        width=PLOT_WIDTH,
        height=PLOT_HEIGHT
    )
)

chart.show()
```

"... What are X and Y?"

> *"It doesn't matter. Just tell us what you think about them."*

"Well I have no idea. What is that, like five points? I can't say much about five data
points."

> *"Good... What about now?"*

```{python}
#| echo: false

chart = (
    alt.Chart(df.head(50))
    .mark_point()
    .encode(
        alt.X("X:Q", axis=alt.Axis(grid=False)),
        alt.Y("Y:Q", axis=alt.Axis(grid=False)),
    )
    .properties(
        width=PLOT_WIDTH,
        height=PLOT_HEIGHT
    )
)

chart.show()
```

"Ok well... It looks like X and Y might be negatively associated... One goes up, the
other goes down."

> *"Are you sure?"*

"Well no... But I could settle it if you showed me more data."

> *"We can show you all of the data collected for this room, if you like?"*

All of it! You sit up, satisfied that you'll know for sure in a moment. The data
flicker onto the screen:

```{python}
#| echo: false

chart = (
    alt.Chart(df)
    .mark_point()
    .encode(
        alt.X("X:Q", axis=alt.Axis(grid=False)),
        alt.Y("Y:Q", axis=alt.Axis(grid=False)),
    )
    .properties(
        width=PLOT_WIDTH,
        height=PLOT_HEIGHT
    )
)

chart.show()
```

You were right.

"Well now I'm sure. X and Y are negatively correlated. I'd bet my life on it."

> *"Please don't. They are not."*

... What? You're looking at the data, it's as plain as anything. Who is this asshole?

"They *are*! It would be silly to deny it. The data I'm looking at show a negative
correlation."

> *"That is correct."*

"So X and Y are negatively correlated!"

> *"Incorrect."*

Your head swings to face the intercom, back to the projector, then back again.

"It's an empiricial bloody fact that they are! You're showing me all of the data!"

> *"I'm showing you all the data collected for this room."*

"What is that supposed to mean? You're hiding something?"

> *"Is that unreasonable?"*

You're standing now. You can feel the anger rising in your chest.

"This is ridiculous. Show me the rest of it! What is the point of this?"

> *"There is more data outside."*

You walk briskly to the only door in the room and grab the handle. Locked.

You breathe out slowly, trying to stay calm.

> *"The door will unlock when you explain the data."*

"I did that already. The data are negatively correlated."

You hear the faint sound of a pencil scraping against paper through the intercom. More
paper shuffling.

> *"The door is still locked. If we let you out now, you'll just get more confused.
> You've pointed out a real pattern. Explain it."*

Another deep breath.

You sit and think. X and Y are linked somehow, you have no doubt about it. 

Then again... you don't know anything about X or Y, so you can't say whether X is
causing Y or the other way around!

$X \rightarrow Y \quad or \quad X \leftarrow Y$

Maybe that's his problem? You're pointing out an association, but you haven't explained
what's causing it. Right!

"I can't specify the causal relationship between X and Y because I lack any background
information about them. All I can say with confidence is that one is influencing the
other somehow."

A long pause, then finally:

> *"Incorrect."*

The anger is building again.

"So you're telling me that X and Y have *nothing* to do with eachother?"

You hear some muffled arguing through the intercom.

> *"... in this case, that is correct."*

Your head hurts. You're looking at it. The data is clear, there's an obvious
relationship! You're had enough of this. 

"... So what? Am I hallucinating? Am I crazy? Am I the fucking problem here?"

More arguing, this time it goes a lot longer. You're pacing up and down the room,
waiting.

You make out the words

> *"...it's a start, isn't it?"*

The data disappears. Symbols take its place:

$X \rightarrow \text{YOU} \leftarrow Y$

You hear a *click*.

> *"The door is unlocked. Go through."*

# Berkson's Paradox

I first learned about [Berkson's
paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkson%27s_paradox) in Richard McElreath's
fantastic [Statistical Rethinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBEA7PKDmiY) series,
and it must have really lodged itself into my brainstem, because I'm still thinking
about it.

Broadly speaking the "paradox" is that spurious, non-causal associations can be induced by
biased sampling.

The effect is so unintuitive to us that it's labelled a "paradox" when it really isn't
one. It's the logical consequence of conditioning data on a
[collider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collider_(statistics))---something that is
affected by multiple variables being examined. I know that doesn't help, so the
following example is useful:

## Ugly Sweethearts, Hot Jerks

This example is reductive and maybe a bit mean-spirited, but for me it's salient enough
that the paradox becomes clear, so I often use it anyway.

Imagine you are dating a lot and you notice that attractive dates seem less friendly,
whereas the friendliest dates are less attractive. This may be a real pattern in your
dating pool. If we imagined that we had good metrics of attractiveness and friendliness,
analyzing them might yield something like this:

```{python}
n = 1000

x = np.random.normal(size=n)
y = np.random.normal(size=n)
z = x + y

lower = -1
upper = 1

conditions = [
    z < lower,
    (z >= lower) & (z < upper),
    z >= upper
]
choices = [
    "Below your standards",
    "Dating you",
    "Out of your league"
]

group = np.select(conditions, choices, default="")

attractiveness = invlogit(x)
friendliness = invlogit(y)

filtered_df = pd.DataFrame({
    "Attractiveness": attractiveness[group == "Dating you"],
    "Friendliness": friendliness[group == "Dating you"],
})

chart = (
    alt.Chart(filtered_df)
    .mark_point()
    .encode(
        alt.X("Attractiveness:Q", axis=alt.Axis(grid=False)),
        alt.Y("Friendliness:Q", axis=alt.Axis(grid=False)),
    )
    .properties(
        width=PLOT_WIDTH,
        height=PLOT_HEIGHT
    )
)

chart.show()
```

So your instincts were right! There's a strong negative association between the dates'
friendliness and attractiveness. We can theorize why---maybe attractive people learn
that they don't need to be nice to get what they want, whereas unattractive people are
always overcompensating... Good story! Intuitive! Real! Causal!

But it's *not* real. It isn't possible to see the full sampling distribution in real
life, but luckily this isn't real life and you aren't going on thousands of dates, I'm
just simulating them with code:


```{python}
df = pd.DataFrame({
    "Attractiveness": attractiveness,
    "Friendliness": friendliness,
    "Group": group
})

chart = (
    alt.Chart(df)
    .mark_point()
    .encode(
        alt.X("Attractiveness:Q", axis=alt.Axis(grid=False)),
        alt.Y("Friendliness:Q", axis=alt.Axis(grid=False)),
        alt.Color(
            "Group:N",
            legend=alt.Legend(orient="top-right")
        )
    )
    .properties(
        width=PLOT_WIDTH,
        height=PLOT_HEIGHT
    )
)

chart.show()
```

In reality there's no connection between friendliness and attractiveness. That
association is caused by *you*. You are selecting, and are being selected for. You
aren't dating all the unattractive, unfriendly people, and the super attractive, super
friendly people aren't dating you! So the band in the middle that you date are the hot
jerks and the ugly sweethearts, and all combinations within that sad envelope of
mediocrity. The pattern is there, but it's not causal! It's a sampling artifact. It's
not real!

$$
\begin{align}
A &\not\rightarrow F \\
A \rightarrow &\text{YOU} \leftarrow F
\end{align}
$$

And what's worse is, the more dates you go on, the *more convinced* you would be of the
pattern. More information is *bad*, it solidifies an incorrect causal model of the
world. Without knowledge of the paradox, you would become more and more convinced that
your dating experience is just how the world is. 

But it's not. You haven't gained any insight on people you pass on the street---in fact
you've gained the opposite---your worldview is warped by the information exposed to you
by dating. Your information gathering has made you worse at understanding the world
around you. 

After all those crappy dates! What a ripoff.

In my view this is by far the most intuitive example of the effect---most are way harder
to think about. For instance...

## Smoking and Infant Mortality

Low birth-weight children born to mothers who smoke have a
[*lower*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_birth-weight_paradox) infant mortality rate
than those born to non-smoking mothers.

So smoking saves skinny babies? 

No. Smoking is a *cause* of low birth-weight in infants. Many other risk factors,
independent of smoking, also *cause* low birth-weight. Low birth-weight is in turn
associated with increased infant mortality:

```{mermaid}
graph TD
    S[Smoking]
    O[Other Risk Factors]
    L[Low Birth Weight]
    M[Infant Mortality]

    S --> L
    O --> L
    L --> M
```

So if you just look at low birth-weight kids (conditioning on the collider), you induce
a totally spurious negative correlation between smoking and infant mortality.

![Good luck understanding that on your first try.](media/wtf.gif)

And this effect is everywhere. Some other examples:

- [Medical research](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10016947/)
- [Criminology](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10061360/)
- [Economics](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/106578/1/Schneider_Collider_Bias_in_Economic_History_Research_2020_v4.pdf)
- [Basketball](https://dylan-sivori.github.io/2021-02-05-nba-ft-percent/)

I think it shows up in day to day life, too... 

## False Frontiers

We (my generation and younger) have been conditioned by video games to think about
attribute allocation as an intuitive part of reality. You roll your character when
you're born, and you get some combination of Strength, Agility, Intelligence, Charisma
and so forth. Allocation implies trade-offs---you can't be super strong, super
intelligent, and super charismatic---not enough points. The athletic jock and the kid
with glasses are sitting on an efficient frontier of personality. Popular culture
reinforces this all the time:

![Pictured: Current popular culture](media/jocks-vs-nerd.jpeg)

This is nonsense, but I think the Berkson paradox reinforces the illusion. 

In many environments we grow up in, we are unwitting participants in a selection
process. Some combination of factors will get you into a nice school. To get into a
university maybe you need a combination of decent grades and extra curriculars. To get a
job you have to meet whatever requirements the employer is looking for, and interview
well. We're always jumping over hurdles to make progress in life, and the higher those
hurdles are, the stronger the Berkson effect will be. 

All of these filters induce negative associations. Hot jerks, short free-throw
specialists, smoking babies... maybe I'm not remembering that one right... But that's
the pattern.

The poor kid in an expensive school? Smart, probably on a scholarship. The dumbass
sitting behind him copying his answers? Dad owns the school. 

The friendly doctor? Nailed all the bed-manner stuff in medschool, but scraped by on
grades, and you're feeling unsure about the flu shot this season. Meanwhile the slender
surgeon with cold, dead eyes exudes enough competence that you fade into unconsciousness
with the image of him holding a scalpel over your exposed flesh and you *feel safe*.

The smiling CTO who knows everybody's name and is super excited about the digital
transformation? Doesn't remember much from his uni days... But the timid engineer in
upper management who avoids eye contact? Wizard.

You get the idea. Not causal. Filtering.

One of my pet theories is that there is a strong Berkson in CEO height and brutality.
The shorter the CEO, the more of a menace they must be to have reached the top. The
short, regular folks settle in middle-management... gentle-giants can climb the ladder
without piling up too many skulls... but if the boss is 5'6? Ruthless. Again, no
causation, just selection.

![Are these Key Performance Indicators indicating key performance to you? Huh!? Show me
the fuckin' quarterlies.](media/joe-pesci.gif)

## Intuitions

This leads me to another point. In abstract examples, Berkson's paradox is notoriously
unintuitive to us. But I think if you place it into familiar, social contexts---where
our brains have evolved to track many complex interactions in a social network---there's
some intuition there. If all those examples above felt kind of... easy to parse, I think
it's because of that latent intuition we have about how human hierarchies work, whereas
the smoking mommy-babies example is totally baffling to us.

Test your intuitions: You wake up tied to a chair in a warehouse. You owe a lot of
money to the most ruthless gang in town. These two walk in:

![I mean come on.](media/gary-v-tony-robbins.jpeg){width=350px}

Are you seriously going to tell me that Tony Robbins is the scary one, here? The giant
who has never had to do more than yawn conspicuously to command a room? 

No. 

What has *Gary Vee*---5 ft tall and about as dangerous looking as a legless
Pomeranian---been doing to become an enforcer for this operation? One of these two
enjoys salsa dancing and the other has an ear collection. You know which is which.

![ChatGPT refused to add the ears. Don't hate me for using the tools at my
disposal.](media/pomeranian.png){width=300px}

Next example: You're in an abandoned hotel in rural Colorado, it's 3 am, you turn a
corner, and:

![P(Regular young girls survive | House is haunted) = Low enough that you run away.](media/creepy-twins.jpeg)

What have those two been up to while the axe murderer has been chasing you around? It's
not tea parties, it's demonic, evil shit. We know this.

The dating example works so well for this reason. Its social and it kind of *feels*
right. It hooks into some evolved machinery in our heads.

So our intuitions are well tuned to the paradox, in the right context.

## Prediction

It might seem weird that I'm saying all these patterns are statistical mirages induced
be filtering, but I'm still treating them as real (well maybe not all of them, some are
just jokes). Doesn't that mean I'm making the mistake I'm writing about? Making
predictions with them?

And that's the thing, prediction doesn't require a causal model. You could look out your
window and think *the trees look angry today, I bet they're pushing the air around
again...* and your prediction would be correct. You're an idiot, but it *is* windy outside.

![What's got them all worked up, this time? Someone calm the palms before they do some
harm!](media/trees.jpeg)

The exception to this is a genuine sampling fluke---your first 10 observations happen to
line up, or whatever. But for a larger sample size the association is probably real, and
predictive, just not causal. 

So what's the difference?

## Counterfactuals and Intervention


## In Everyday Life 

In my view the Berkson paradox is especially pernicious because:

1. It is common
2. It is usually invisible to us
3. It reinforces a false causal model of the world

If it still seems isolated to contrived examples, maybe it is helpful to zoom out a bit. 

The key here is *selection*---the effect is induced by the process of information
collection. Any information that you consider in your day-to-day, that you use to make
sense of the world, is subject to selection by your media, your government, and more
recently AI algorithms that are tuned to your patterns of engagement.

That means the news you see, the images and videos that show up on your feed, the
opinions you hear, have all passed through a filter. You're seeing your dating pool of
the world's information---you're sampling your narrow band and forming associations from
it.

## Is it Newsworthy?

Imagine you have a god's eye view of the world and you're tracking claims made by people
in terms of how "engaging", and how "factual" they are. Let's be generous and assume
there is no relationship between the two.

These claims can be anything---assassination attempts... dreams I had last night... wars
breaking out... what your neighbour's dog ate for breakfast three weeks ago...---they
could be ridiculous, plausible, exciting, boring or anything in between.

Given some selection from the algorithm, optimized for an individual's engagement, we
can imagine it is more likely a person will be exposed to claims if they are some
combination of engaging and factual. Let's say the probability an individual will see it
is some function of both.

```{python}
n = 5000

x = np.random.normal(size=n)
y = np.random.normal(size=n)
p = invlogit(10*(x + y) - 15)

on_feed = np.where(
    np.random.binomial(n=1, p=p, size=n),
    True, False
)

df = pd.DataFrame({
    "Engaging": x,
    "Factual": y,
    "On Feed": on_feed
})

chart = (
    alt.Chart(df)
    .mark_point()
    .encode(
        alt.X("Engaging:Q", axis=alt.Axis(grid=False)),
        alt.Y("Factual:Q", axis=alt.Axis(grid=False)),
        alt.Color(
            "On Feed:N",
            legend=alt.Legend(orient="top-right")
        )
    )
    .properties(
        width=PLOT_WIDTH,
        height=PLOT_HEIGHT
    )
)

chart.show()
```

This individual might have the impression that there is a negative association between
factfulness and engagement. Outrageous claims on the news are associated with bullshit,
whereas the boring stuff is probably true... A false, troubling association.

It gets more interesting if we consider that different people---liberals and
conservatives, for example---are engaged by different things.

Here's how the feeds of liberals and conservatives look, assuming their engagement is
negatively correlated.

```{python}
corr_matrix = np.array([
    [1.0, -1.0],
    [-1.0, 1.0]
])
engagement = np.random.multivariate_normal(
    mean=[0, 0], 
    cov=corr_matrix, 
    size=n
)

libs = engagement[:, 0]
cons = engagement[:, 1]

p_libs = invlogit(10*(libs + y) - 15)
p_cons = invlogit(10*(cons + y) - 15)

libs_feed = np.where(
    np.random.binomial(n=1, p=p_libs, size=n),
    True, False
)
cons_feed = np.where(
    np.random.binomial(n=1, p=p_cons, size=n),
    True, False
)

conditions = [
    libs_feed & cons_feed,    # Both feeds
    libs_feed & ~cons_feed,   # Liberal feed only  
    ~libs_feed & cons_feed,   # Conservative feed only
]
choices = ["Both", "Libs Only", "Cons Only"]
feeds = np.select(conditions, choices, default="Neither")

df = pd.DataFrame({
    "Engaging": cons,
    "Factual": y,
    "Feed": feeds
})

chart = (
    alt.Chart(df)
    .mark_point()
    .encode(
        alt.X("Engaging:Q", axis=alt.Axis(grid=False)),
        alt.Y("Factual:Q", axis=alt.Axis(grid=False)),
        alt.Color(
            "Feed:N",
            legend=alt.Legend(orient="top-right")
        )
    )
    .properties(
        width=PLOT_WIDTH,
        height=PLOT_HEIGHT
    )
)

chart.show()
```

The liberals and conservatives live in the same universe, so their factual axes are
shared, but the engagement axes are mirrored. The left wing of the x axis appeals to the
liberal brain, and the right wing the conservative brain.

There is a sliver of sanity in the middle of the distribution where conservatives and
liberals are engaging with the same information, probably about budgets and laws and
boring stuff like that. But there is a lot of information being lost across the
political divide.

And the perception from someone about the other side might be that they are all nuts...
I mean look at all the crazy stuff they are talking about! You'd never come across these
things unless you peeked across the divide to see what was happening. And when you look,
you're shocked at the wrongness of it all, your suspicions about the other side are all
confirmed. We're being served different diets and you haven't been weaned onto theirs.
