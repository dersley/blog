I'm making this blog to better organize my thoughts and developing my writing skills,
mostly through technical/programming/science communication. It will probably contain 
coding tutorials, weird opinion pieces, and maybe the occasional book review.

I don't know if what I think is of interest to anybody, so I am beginning this project
with the humble goal of writing things that I would enjoy reading.
