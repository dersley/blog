I moved to Melbourne last year, which, along with being a questionable career choice,
turned an already troubling dependence on caffeine into a behavioural disorder. 

I bought a Nespresso machine, telling myself I would save money on coffee. Now, with the
help of my Nespresso machine I have more than doubled my coffee consumption. The coffee
pod coffee doesn't count, you see. Yes I'll come down for a coffee, I haven't had mine
yet.

This leads me to wonder how much of my family's future I am eroding to bean-dust, every
time I head downstairs for another *medium latte, thanks*---an absent droning sound I
make every morning between the hours of 9 and 10 am. Each *milky-upper* is costing me
$6. So assuming I work 250 days in a year... let's see now:

```{python}
COFFEE_COST = 6.0
WORKING_DAYS = 250

annual_cost = COFFEE_COST * WORKING_DAYS
```

It's $`{python} annual_cost`. You can check the code if you want to make sure I got
that.

I'm not *devastated* by that number---it's not a small amount, but neither is it enough
to send my first born to school---and perhaps a less masochstic person would leave the
matter there... but it does beg the question of what I might be doing with that $1500 a
year if I wasn't spending it on *morning browns for morning frowns*.

# Opportunity Cost, and Futures Lost...

So I know what you're thinking, the obvious thing to do here is run a forecasted
investment strategy using a geometric brownian motion stochastic model of returns based
on the past 20 years of ASX market data. Instead of $6 a day for *cofvefe*, the model
will invest into the Vanguard ETF instead. Then, after 20 years, we can see how Nick the
*coffee dribbler* is doing, compared to Nick the *slightly more financially responsible*
adult.

Before we get all trigger happy with a stochastic model, let's have a look at how this
strategy performs assuming a 6% annual return on the market.

Because it's not far off from the truth, I'll just assume I buy one coffee a day for
simplicity.

```{python}
def create_date_array(start_date: datetime, num_months: int):
    start = np.datetime64(start_date.replace(day=1), 'M')
    month_array = start + np.arange(num_months)
    return month_array.astype("datetime64[D]")

def annual_to_monthly_rate(annual_rate: float) -> float:
    return (1 + annual_rate) ** (1 / 12) - 1

YEARS = 18
ANNUAL_RETURN = 0.06

num_months = YEARS * 12
months = np.arange(num_months)
dates = create_date_array(datetime.today(), num_months=num_months)

investing = np.full_like(dates, COFFEE_COST * 30).astype(float)
spending = -1 * investing

monthly_return = annual_to_monthly_rate(ANNUAL_RETURN)
returns = investing * np.exp(monthly_return * months)

df = pd.DataFrame({
    "Date": dates,
    "Spending": np.cumsum(spending),
    "Investing": np.cumsum(investing),
    "Returns": np.cumsum(returns)
})
flat_df = df.melt(
    id_vars=["Date"], 
    var_name="Case", 
    value_name="Balance ($)"
)
```

```{python}
chart = (
    alt.Chart(flat_df)
    .mark_area(opacity=0.8)
    .encode(
        alt.X("Date:T"),
        alt.Y("Balance ($):Q"),
        alt.Color(
            "Case:N",
            legend=alt.Legend(orient="top-left")
        ),
    )
    .properties(
        height=PLOT_HEIGHT,
        width=PLOT_WIDTH
    )
)

chart.show()
```
