### Nicholas Dorsch - Geoscientist/Data Analyist
I come from a geology and geophysics background working in the oil and gas industry, but
over the years have developed a passion for bayesian statistics and data science more
broadly. My skillset includes a mixture of geology and geophysics workflows as well as
more general purpose statistical modelling. The intersection of these things has allowed
me to work on fairly unique projects during my career. 

I strongly believe that bayesian statistical models offer the most robust and flexible
framework for uncertainty quantification, as well as decision making under uncertainty.
For that reason they have become my career focus.

More recently I have developed more data engineering skills, working with database
design and management. My goal is to become a "full stack" data scientist, capable of
managing and deploying analytical processes end to end, to help organisations make the
best use of their data.
